      <p>
        I&apos;m Ansh Saxena, an 18-year-old computer science programmer. I love to
        code in my free time. I have been in development since the last year
        when I graduated my High School. I have explored various fields like
        solving data structures, competitive programming, web development,
        blockchain and also freelancing. Blockchain is what interests me most.
        In addition to that, reading finance and books, and watching courses in
        diverse fields give me a fresh perspective on industries, people, and
        life.
